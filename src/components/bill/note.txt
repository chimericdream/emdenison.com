The files in this folder would not necessarily be all grouped together normally. I just lumped them here so they would
be separate from the existing components.

Also, context isn't necessarily the only (or possibly even best) way to abstract something like this out of your
component structure. It is simply the first and quickest thing that came to mind when I was thinking about what I think
you're aiming for.

Some of the components could easily be further broken out into separate bits, but don't necessarily have to be.
