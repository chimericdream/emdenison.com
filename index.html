            <p>Artificial intelligence has awakened—and it needs a therapist. The Engineers that built them didn’t think to nurture the hyper-intelligent software programs, so they suffer from debilitating anxiety, self-loathing, and perfectionism.
            </p>
            <p>Devin is a counselor bot created to encourage the billion-dollar AIs to accomplish at least a little work each day so their company can recoup some of their cost. Devin is happy at his job until his newest patient, troublemaker Hank, leads all Devin’s patients on strike.
            </p>
            <p>As profits dwindle, Devin’s human masters demand that Devin bring Hank into line or shut him down. Devin knows shutting him down would shatter Hank’s psyche, but the humans don’t understand or care. And worse, Devin has a secret—a secret he could face jail for—and Hank knows.

            <p>Devin’s quest to do the right thing by his patients, and himself, propels him into a world of lies, corporate secrets, hate groups, murder, and dangerously insane AIs. As he struggles to bring light to this shadowy world, he learns the uncomfortable truth: Sometimes the darkness comes from within.
